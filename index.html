<h2>Hello, and welcome to my site!</h2>
<p>Thank you for checking my page out. The purpose of this site is to showcase who I am and what I've done across my academic career. 
    This is a self-led project intended to get myself familiar with website development (more specifically, vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).</p>

<p> 
    As I am taking 17 credit hours this semester, development of this site will remain slow. I want to push myself
    for academic excellence, so my priorities will be focused on school. Feel free to see what <i>is</i> done here.
    </p>

<p>The <b>About</b> page highlights who I am and what my academic accomplishments are.</p>

<p>I like messing around with coding! Feel free to check out my <b>Experiments</b> page to see activities I have integrated into the webpage.</p>

<p>If you would like to reach out to me, you can find my contact information in the <b>Contact Me</b> page.</p>
