<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p> My name is Keifer Buss. I am 22 years old, and I am currently attending the University of Wyoming (UW).
    I expect to graduate in 2026 with concurrent Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics.
    My interests include logic and puzzle games, small coding projects, and mini-golf. Ultimately, 
    I enjoy challenging myself to learn. </p>

<div class="v_padded">
<h2> Accomplishments </h2>
<p> At UW, I currently hold a <b>3.91</b> GPA, being on the Presidential Honor Roll several times. 
    I am also Vice President of UW's <b>Upsilon Pi Epsilon</b> International Honor Society chapter. </p>

<p> Prior to attending UW, I attended the <b>Frontiers of Science Institute program</b> in 2021 at the University of Northern Colorado.
    This was a six-week program in which students performed collegiate work in STEM fields ranging from biology to programming to statistics.
    The program culminated in groups creating a research paper in their interests, where I worked with group members and 
    an expert to analyze how COVID-19 impacted anxiety and social media use in adolescents as a pilot study. </p>

<p> During my senior year at Cody High School, I earned UW's <b>Trustees' scholarship</b>. This involves a two-stage application process:
    submitting the initial application and responding to both an online and in-person interview at the university. 
    UW <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/sfa/scholarships/residents/trustees.html">describes this award</a>
     as the "premier scholarship for the best and brightest Wyoming high school seniors."
    Furthermore, I was the <b>salutatorian</b> of my class at Cody High School, and I was part of the school's <b>National Honor Society</b> chapter. </p>
